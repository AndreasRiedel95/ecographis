# Steps to Generate Production Files with Prepros

### 1. Install Prepros
   - First, download and install Prepros if you haven’t already. It's available for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

### 2. Add Your Project to Prepros
   - Open Prepros and drag your project folder into the app, or use the “Add Project” button to select it.

### 3. Configure Output Settings
   - Select the files you want to process (e.g., SCSS, CSS, JavaScript).
   - Click on a file to view its options and choose an output folder. Prepros lets you customize where to save the processed files.

### 4. Enable Minification
   - In each file's settings, enable the **Minify** option. Prepros will then create minified versions of your CSS and JavaScript files, which are optimized for production.

### 5. Set Up Autoprefixing and Other Optimizations
   - Prepros supports **autoprefixing** for CSS, **sourcemaps**, and other optimizations. Configure these options as needed to ensure compatibility across browsers and better debugging.

### 6. Compile All Files
   - Once you’ve set up all configurations, click **Compile** to generate the production-ready files. Prepros will minify, autoprefix, and save the compiled files in the designated folder.

### 7. Live Preview (Optional)
   - Prepros includes a **live preview** feature, which helps you see changes instantly in the browser. This can be handy during development before building for production.
